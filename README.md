# Maggiec: Baking & cupcakes
This is the Maggie's bakery product landing page. I did a mark based on Maggie Alacio's, my girlfriend, preferences. Videos and photos are of [Freepik.com](https://freepik.es) and the vectors are based in [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com) but made by me. At the end you can see a the mobile version because is a site responsive. Try the page by yourself [click here!](https://mefistocontreras.github.io/bakeplp/).

## About the Maggiec
This is the first part of page. Have a navbar that follows you when you scroll. This is formed by a the logo, and three fundamental parts of the landing page:
